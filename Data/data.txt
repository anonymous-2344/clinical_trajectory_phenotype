Data Source:
Our primary data source is the MIMIC-III v1.4 database, which contains detailed information on over 40,000 patients admitted to critical care units at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) between 2001 and 2012. The database is publicly available under pre-existing Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Researchers can access it by completing the “Data or Specimens Only Research” training course offered by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI).

Cohort Selection:
Our experiments were conducted on a cohort of 1,660 sepsis-related hospital admissions.

Demographics: from ADMISSIONS.csv and PATIENTS.csv
Nursing Notes: from NOTEEVENTS.csv
Vitals & Lab Events: from CHARTEVENTS.csv and LABEVENTS.csv


Structured Data:
The folder structured_data contains 27 structured parameters, representing day-wise worst values after our preprocessing pipeline.

Question Bank:
The file Question_bank.xlsx includes a list of discriminative contrastive questions generated by our model.
